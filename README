botulism: irc bot caused by improperly preserved shell script

This is a fairly simple IRC bot, meant to be used with the ii filesystem-based
IRC client. Currently included functionality depends on fortune(6), dc(1), the
mpc MPD client, weather(1) from the Debian package weather-utils, and the
reference implementation of the dict(1) client. Apart from this, the code should
run on any reasonably POSIX-compliant system.

There are multiple known security issues, and probably other unknown ones.
Removing or modifying the .dc command is needed to prevent DoS, and the .giveup
command only exists for debugging purposes and should not be run in any public
channel.

Other ii bots are probably much cleaner, this one has the advantage of being
pure POSIX sh (and the advantage for me that I understand its internals ;) ).
