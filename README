botulism: irc bot caused by improperly preserved shell script

This is a fairly simple IRC bot, meant to be used with the ii filesystem-based
IRC client. Currently included functionality depends on fortune(6), dc(1), the
mpc MPD client, weather(1) from the Debian package weather-utils, and the
reference implementation of the dict(1) client. Apart from this, the code should
run on any reasonably POSIX-compliant system.

There are not any security issues I know of, but there are  probably unknown ones.
In particular, the .giveup command only exists for debugging purposes and should
not be run in any public channel. If you're thinking of running this publicly,
look long and hard at .apropos and .dict in particular, as they allow passing
arbitrary flags to the eponymous UNIX commands. I believe .dc to be safe (and
the permitted subset of the dc(1) language to be far from Turing-complete), but
you'd do well to look at it closely too.

Other ii bots are probably much cleaner, this one has the advantage of being
pure POSIX sh (and the advantage for me that I understand its internals ;) ).
